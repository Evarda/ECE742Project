\subsection{PML}
Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) boundary conditions are absorbing boundary
conditions. PML BCs decay the wave within a boundary layer at the edge of the
simulation. The edge of the simulation BC can be implemented as PEC.
Well-implemented PML BCs completely decay the wave from the time it enters the
boundary layer to the time after it reflects and attempts to leave.

Reflection Factor
$R(\theta)=\exp^{-2\eta cos(\theta)\int_{0}^{d}\sigma_{x}(x)dx}$
Where $\sigma_{x}$ is

PMLs are exact for continuous functions, but error is introduced for discrete functions. Having a large step discontinuity can
