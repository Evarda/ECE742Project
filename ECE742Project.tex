\subsection{PML}
Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) boundary conditions are absorbing boundary conditions. PML BCs decay the wave within a boundary layer at the edge of the simulation. The edge of the simulation BC can be implemented as PEC. Well-implemented PML BCs completely decay the wave from the time it enters the boundary layer to the time after it reflects and attempts to leave.
